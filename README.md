If you have any questions on how to interact with Git/GitHub please ask and I'll try to write up some information here.
There are a few methods to which we can operate, one would be to have self-governing rules which each member is able to 
update the repository. This is more apt to generate conflicts which are not fun as projects grow in scale.

Alternativley, you can work on your own local repository by forking this project or simply work on this repository by
branching. Both approaches have similar end results. Merging the code into the master repository using this method
is then typically handled through the pull request system built into GitHub as it does a fairly good job of assessing
possible conflicts which may arise.
